# chickenWeight App Overview
### Written by: Peter Sedivec

This was my attempt at building a simple shiny app for the Coursera Developing
Data Products course. I looked at a handful of built-in R datasets and finally 
settled on ChickWeight dataset since it seemed like an easy data set to work with
that I could graph results and use input widgets to allow user to control a few 
variables

A synopsis of the dataset is available here

### App Details

My app basically allows for the exploration of the data set allowing a user to
compare diets graphically and to only look at a subset of a diet based on the 
Chick ending weight.  I assumed that in raising chickens the ending weight was
an important, probably the most important, factor since you want to grow healthy
chickens to maturity quickly and have them be as heavy as possible, assuming 
your a farmer and you're interested in selling the chickens to make money
